# Guilt & Remembrance
Mod for handling civilian deaths, reparations, and war crimes in Arma 3. Atone for your "collateral damage" by bringing the bodies of dead civilians back to their family — or else attempt to conceal the deaths by secretly disposing of the evidence.

Requirements: [CBA_A3](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3), [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3)

**FEATURES:**

_Civilian Deaths_
* When a player kills a civilian, a new task is generated requiring the player to deliver the body to a member of their family, who lives in a house in the AO (within 20km by default).
* Alternatively, players may attempt to conceal the death by taking the body at least 300m away from a populated center, burying it, and striking off the dead civilian’s name from the grave marker.
* Dead civilians are announced to everyone on the same side and marked on the map.

_Burial and Exhumation_
* Any corpse in a body bag can now be buried or exhumed (requires an Entrenching Tool).
* Burying any corpse produces a burial mound from which the dead person’s name and age can be read.
* The items carried by the dead are transferred to the body bag, and persist through burial and exhumation.

_Autopsies_
* Medics and Doctors can perform an autopsy on any body in the field to determine cause of death (requires Surgical Kit).
* When performed by a Doctor or near a medical facility, an autopsy can also determine the time of death, the faction of the killer — and can even reveal the identity of an unknown victim whose death had been concealed, allowing the body to be returned to his family.

_Customization_
* Mission creators can attach functions to event handlers to produce custom events upon civilian death, body delivery to next-of-kin, death concealment, or reveal of the identity of an unknown victim via autopsy.

**FOR PLAYERS:**
In order to deliver a dead civilian to their family member, you must first place it in a Body Bag via an ACE action (Interactions -> Place body in body bag). The Body Bag can then be loaded into the cargo of a vehicle, driven to the destination, unloaded, and then manually dragged to the relative.

(Note: while the task to deliver the body is created immediately after you have killed the civilian, you will not be notified for 20-60 seconds so as not to distract you if you happen to be in the middle of combat.)

You can also bury or exhume any body bags if you are carrying an Entrenching Tool. Autopsies can be performed if you are carrying a Surgical Kit.

You can change how your notifications for civilian casualties are displayed in your Addon Options (listed under "Guilt & Remembrance."). Note that this setting may be overriden by the mission creator or server operator.

**FOR MISSION CREATORS & SERVER OPERATORS:**
This mod is fully signed for multiplayer use, and has been tested on both local and dedicated servers. It must be run on both the client and server. 

The following mod settings are customizable from your mission scripts (run only on server):

```
// set the civilian types that will act as next-of-kin
GR_CIV_TYPES = ["C_man_polo_1_F_asia","C_man_polo_5_F_asia"];

// set the maximum distance from murder that next-of-kin will be spawned
GR_MAX_KIN_DIST = 20000;

// Chance that a player murdering a civilian will get an "apology" mission
GR_MISSION_CHANCE = 100;

// Delay in seconds after death until player is notified of body delivery mission
GR_TASK_MIN_DELAY=20;
GR_TASK_MID_DELAY=40;
GR_TASK_MAX_DELAY=60;

// Set custom faction names to determine blame when performing an autopsy
GR_FACTIONNAME_EAST = "CSAT";
GR_FACTIONNAME_WEST = "NATO";
GR_FACTIONNAME_IND = "the Syndikat";

// You can also add/remove custom event handlers to be called upon
// certain events.

// On civilian murder by player:
[yourCustomEvent_OnCivDeath] call GR_fnc_addCivDeathEventHandler; // args [_killer, _killed, _nextofkin]
// (NOTE: _nextofkin will be nil if a body delivery mission wasn't generated.)
[yourCustomEvent_OnCivDeath] call GR_fnc_removeCivDeathEventHandler;

// On body delivery:
[yourCustomEvent_OnDeliverBody] call GR_fnc_addDeliverBodyEventHandler; // args [_killer, _nextofkin, _body]
[yourCustomEvent_OnDeliverBody] call GR_fnc_removeDeliverBodyEventHandler;

// On successful concealment of a death:
[yourCustomEvent_OnConcealDeath] call GR_fnc_addConcealDeathEventHandler; // args [_killer, _nextofkin, _grave]
[yourCustomEvent_OnConcealDeath] call GR_fnc_removeConcealDeathEventHandler;

// On reveal of a concealed death via autopsy:
[yourCustomEvent_OnRevealDeath] call GR_fnc_addRevealDeathEventHandler; // args [_medic, _body, _killerSide]
[yourCustomEvent_OnRevealDeath] call GR_fnc_removeRevealDeathEventHandler;

// NOTE: if your event handler uses _nextofkin or _body, make sure to turn off garbage collection with:
// _nextofkin setVariable ["GR_WILLDELETE",false];
// _body setVariable ["GR_WILLDELETE",false];
